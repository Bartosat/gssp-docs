LoRa stands for **Long-Range**. It is a modulation techonology. LoRa enables very long range communication links at a nominal power level.  LoRa can be extremely resistant to radio interference and can be operated in very harsh conditions.
The low-power, and long-range characteristcs of this technology makes it a suitable one for IoT applications.
